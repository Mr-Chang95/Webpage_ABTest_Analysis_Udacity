# Webpage_ABTest_Analysis_Udacity

Date Created: 11/27/2021

For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. This project was done using the programming language, Python.

Packages used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and random. 

We used three different methods to analyze whether or not to launch a new landing page:

Probability
A/B testing
Logistic regression

For this project, we will use the datasets, 'countries.csv' and 'ab_data.csv'. The original project was turned into Udacity as an HTML file, but I deleted it because the codes are the same as in the Jupyter notebook.
