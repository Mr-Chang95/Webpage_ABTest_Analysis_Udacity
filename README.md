# Webpage_ABTest_Analysis_Udacity

Date Created: 11/27/2021

## Project Overview

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these. For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users. My goal was to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Installation 
You need to be able to work in a Jupyter Notebook on your computer. The following packages (libraries) need to be installed. You can install these packages via conda or pip.
~~~~~~
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels
- Scipy
~~~~~~

We used three different methods to analyze whether or not to launch a new landing page:

Probability
A/B testing
Logistic regression

For this project, we will use the datasets, 'countries.csv' and 'ab_data.csv'. The original project was turned into Udacity as an HTML file, but I deleted it because the code is the same as in the Jupyter notebook.
